# mtmkdev-org-big1

This is a development and test org for GitHub App development by @mtmk (following this org for proof). The large number of repos are created to test GitHub App initial repo syncronization. Repo creation is done at a vey slow pace not to trigger any secondary rate limits.

**GitHub staff:** I believe this does not violate GitHub's terms but if you think otherwise please contact me.
